# Programming in the tidyverse

This repository contains code from the course [Programming in the tidyverse](https://krlmlr.github.io/tidyprog/) by Kirill MÃ¼ller and Tobias Schieferdecker from May 29, 2019.

The course material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/krlmlr/tidyprog-proj/tree/2019-05-zhr/script).

The course uses interesting packages for workflow management such as [fs](https://fs.r-lib.org/) and [here](https://here.r-lib.org/).

The [vctrs](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/) package is also introduced briefly.
